    "#### Introduction : Business Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will try to find an optimal location for a **Korean restaurant** in the **Greater Vancouver**, British Columbia, Canada. \n",
    "Vancouver is located in the west coast Canada and has the highest population density in Canada, with over 5,400 people per square kilometre which makes it the fifth-most densely populated city with over 250,000 residents in North America. The population of Vancouver and Greater Vancouver is about **2.5 million**.  Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada. 52% of its residents are not native English speakers, 48.9% are native speakers of either English or French, and 50.6% of residents belong to visible minority groups. The Chinese are the largest visible ethnic group in the city(26.5%). Other significant Asian ethnic groups in Vancouver are South and West Asian (7.4%), Filipino (5.9%), Japanese (1.7%), Korean (1.5%), as well as sizeable communities of Vietnamese, Indonesians, and Cambodians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a high populated and ethnically diversified city, Vancouver offers multicultural restaurants in many neighbourhoods.  To reflect the high Asian population, you can easily find the Asian restaurants in most of neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of restaurants in Vancouver we will try to select locations that **are already crowded with existing Asian restaurants but not too many Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This report will be targeted for any **clients who are new to the city and have interests to set up a new Korean restaurant or any clients who already own a restaurant but search for a new optimal location**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our data science technique to generate a few most promising neighbourhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our Business problem, factors that will influence our decision are:\n",
    "number of existing Asian restaurants in the neighbourhood\n",
    "number of and distance to Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood, if any\n",
    "\n",
    "Greater Vancouver is divided by many sub cities. There are near 9000 Asian restaurants in the greater Vancouver area. With Foursquare API’s restriction returning top 100, we will loop thru the below coordinates using Foursquare API to extract the full list of Asian restaurants.   \n",

    "Foursquare has venue data with categories and geo locations for food and type of restaurants. Data can be searched by area and retrieved in GeoJSON format. The Foursquare data is crowdsourced, so accuracy is not guaranteed and may have duplicate entries for the same venue and incorrect category assignments.\n",

    "It’s worth noting that Foursquare API only returned 25 Korean restaurants without specifying “**intent=browse**”. The default is “**intent=checkin**” which does not return restaurants if you are outside of Foursquare defined check-in area.  This is sufficient number of restaurants to group compare restaurant density thru the greater Vancouver area. "
